# This is my first bootstrap exercise.

Welcome! and Take it easy!

This is a learning bootstrap.

We have done the following: 
1. Added text with h1 h2 h3 and normal dummy text
2. Added divs and lists
3. adjusted columns
4. block quotes
5. buttons
6. adding bootstrap CSS libraries to the page (which is very interesting)
7. adding nav bar
